 ## Description
This API is designed for a note-taking web application that allows users to create, edit, and manage their notes seamlessly. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the technologies and functionalities involved:

- Note Taking App is a comprehensive project developed as part of the Ohio State coding boot camp.
- My motivation for this project was to enhance my skills in backend development using JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, alongside tools like Mongoose, Insomnia, and Moment.js.
- Building this project provided me with an opportunity to apply the coding techniques I have been studying for 17 weeks, specifically focusing on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations essential for note management.
- This application serves as a practical example of real-world software development practices and demonstrates how to effectively write backend code for a note-taking application.
- Through this project, I gained valuable experience in coding and testing routes for a backend API tailored for a note-taking application, ensuring smooth functionality for users managing their notes.

 ## User Story
- AS A small business owner
- I WANT to be able to write and save notes
- SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

 ## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a note-taking application
- WHEN I open the Note Taker
- THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
- WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
- THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand -    column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
- WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
- THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at  the top of the page
- WHEN I click on the Save button
- THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column  with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
- WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
- THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
- WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page
- THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears

## Technologies 
[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
    - Routing: Express.js handles the routing for our API, directing HTTP requests to the appropriate handlers.
    - Middleware: Utilizes middleware for parsing JSON, handling errors, and managing sessions/authentication.

[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
   - API Testing: Insomnia is utilized to test API endpoints and ensure they work correctly.
   - Seed Data Creation: Facilitates the creation of seed data by sending HTTP requests to populate the database with initial data for testing and development.
